iPeg Solitaire
==============

iPeg Solitaire, also known as Solitaire, Brainvita or HiQ, is an iPhone implementation of the classic one-player puzzle game whose goal is to remove all pegs from the board until there is only one peg left. A peg can be removed from the board by jumping over it with an adjacent peg to an empty hole.

Features:

+ Several board variations: English, European, 6x6, Fireplace, Cross, Pyramid and much much more to come
+ Save and restore: simply close the application and the next time you play it will be exactly as you left it
+ Three undo modes: unlimited, 3 and none
+ Highscores stored for each board
